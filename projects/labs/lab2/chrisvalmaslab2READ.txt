Part 1.
	I am using html 5.0 markup since I have the most experience with html. I made it so all the info is wrapped in a div with the picture below it. This allows for an easy list like structure and css to be easily applied.

Part 2.

I have a root followed by children and their subchildren. This is the structure that proper XML should have. Along with proper identification of different elements.

Part 3.

For the HTML file I assigned all the different classes that I needed to edit in the CSS file for easier access. Also used IDS

Part 4.

Had all the elements nicely named so editing them in the css file would be easy. I couldn't get the img tags to work or the hyperlinks though they kept giving me an error.
