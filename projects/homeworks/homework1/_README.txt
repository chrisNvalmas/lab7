Chris Valmas Assignment 1

1. 
	a. I did not take the intro class so I only really have 		experience with html 5. That is why I used it and css 2.1 is what 	I have experience with too.
	
	b. Compared to things like xml my doctype follows the same nested 	pattern and could be easily tweaked to work with xml.

	c. I only used divs to group common info together for better 	styling and better formatting. I also only used spans to do 	inline styling (having it so info showed up on the same line). 	According to html 5 this is proper semantic way 	to use divs and 	spans.
	
	d. The hCard info I added will allow for easy parsing because I 	labeled all information that could be useful. All the 	user/machine has to look for are key hCard words. 

2. W3Schools (basically looked up how to unstyle links, center an 		image and used the DOM model it had as a reference)
